# NPE_parameterestimation_glioblastoma
This repository contains Matlab codes for the thesis of the exam of Mathematical Models for Biomedicine, a.y. 2022-23 at Politecnico di Torino, held by prof. Chiara Giverso, prof. Luigi Preziosi and prof. Luca Mesin. The work was made in cooperation with my colleagues Lorenzo Dal Zovo and Enrico Ortu. The MDN structures were implemented with the help of NetLab3.3 Matlab library

The work aimed to develop a Neural Parameter Estimation (NPE) pipeline to predict diffusion and growth parameter of glioblastomas. All the data and packages needed to run and test this codes are in this repository.
Since this material had been developed to support a university course assignment, this repository provides all the steps and tests followed in order to obtain the definitive Machine Learning model for glioblastomas. Simulations and Data used to train and evaluate the model had been implemented using the software Comsol MultiPhyisics.
